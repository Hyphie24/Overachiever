==============================

Original Author: Tuhljin

Fan FIx Author: Hyphie

Tools and tweaks to make the lives of players seeking Achievements a little bit easier.

General:

* Slash commands to search for achievements by name.
* Ctrl+click on an achievement link to open the UI to that achievement. Ctrl+click again to track it.
* Optionally display your progress toward earning an achievement in links provided by others for easy comparison.
* Click and drag to move the Achievement frame around the screen.
* Add information from progress bars and normally-hidden progress information to your achievement tooltips. (For
  example, "Progress: 5/10" or "Assault 2 bases (0/2).")
* Display a tooltip when hovering over an achievement in the Objectives frame to see more details about it.
* Shift+click an achievement title in the Objectives frame to add that achievement's link to chat.
* The tooltips of meta-criteria (achievements displayed as the criteria for obtaining a larger achievement) changed
  from simply giving the date the criteria was met or nothing (if not met) to the standard, detailed tooltip for the
  achievement.
* And more!

Achievement-specific:

* Automatically track exploration achievements as you travel (if desired).
* Critters' tooltips remind you which ones you need to earn "To All The Squirrels I've Loved Before."
* "Well Read" and "Higher Learning": Add whether you've read a relevant book to its tooltip.
* "The Scavenger," "Outland Angler," and "Northrend Angler", etc.: Show whether you've fished a node in its tooltip.
* "Let It Snow" and "Fistful of Love": Show whether you need to use a Handful of Snowflakes or a Handful of Rose
  Petals on players in their tooltips.
* "Shake Your Bunny-Maker": Show whether you need to use Spring Flowers on players in their tooltips. Enemy players
  of an unknown level are assumed to be at least level 18.
* "It's Happy Hour Somewhere" and "Tastes Like Chicken": Show whether you've consumed a food or drink item.
* Select a sound effect to play when one of the above reminders show up in a tooltip if you need to do something.
* And many more.

Options can be found using the /oa command or at Interface Options -> AddOns tab -> Overachiever.

--------------

KEY BINDINGS:

You can associate key bindings with each of the new tabs added to the Achievement frame using the standard key binding
interface. The new bindings are located under the heading "Overachiever."


SLASH COMMANDS:

- ALTERED: /ach and its aliases (/achieve, /achievement, and /achievements)

  You can now add the name, part of the name, or the numerical ID of an achievement to search for it. If you search
using a number, then achievements with that number in their names will be included in addition to the achievement with that
number ID. You may narrow this down by putting a "#" sign before the ID. For instance, if you search for "#500", then
achievement number 500 will be returned but achievements like "500 Fish" and "500 Quests Completed" will not.

  If the option "Slash commands use Search tab" is checked (default), the results are displayed in the Search tab. Otherwise,
they are output to the chat log and the GUI is opened to the first match.

  Example A: /ach
   - Result: Toggle visibility of the main achievement UI.
  Example B: /ach gold
   - Result: Search for achievements with "gold" in their names.
  Example C: /ach #1206
   - Result: Find the achievement with ID number 1206.
  Example D: /ach 80
   - Result: Find the achievement with ID number 80 and also find achievements with "80" in their names.

- NEW: /achsilent, /achs

  These commands silently search for the first matching achievement and display it. Useful if you don't want text
  added to the chat log but don't want to open to the Search tab, either.

  Example A: /achs gold
   - Result: Finds the first achievement with "gold" in its name and opens the UI to it.
  Example B: /achs #1206
   - Result: Opens the achievement UI to the achievement whose ID is 1206.

- NEW: /oa

  As /ach, except that if no argument is provided, Overachiever's interface options are displayed instead of the
  main achievement UI.

- NEW: /oasilent, /oas

  As /achsilent, except that if no argument is provided, Overachiever's interface options are displayed instead of the
  main achievement UI.


DRAGGABLE FRAMES:

The main achievement frame (where achievements earned and unearned are listed by category) is draggable when the proper
Interface Options are set. Left-click on an appropriate area and hold the mouse button down to move the frame where you
desire.

By default, the main achievement frame can be moved but it is still subject to some standard frame handling that will
reposition it when it is opened or certain other frames are displayed. To unattach the frame from this position
handling and have Overachiever remember where the frame is from session to session, check the "Remember position"
option under the "Main Achievement UI frame" option. Once in the position you desire, you may want to uncheck the
"Main Achievement UI frame" option so you don't accidentally move it elsewhere.


EXPLORATION AUTO-TRACKING:

When enabled, Overachiever automatically starts tracking the Exploration achievement for your current zone as you travel
(unless you've completed that achievement).


Change log
==========

The change log lists changes of particular note to users, not every change made.

v1.2.3
- Updated toc for 9.2
- Added Suggestions for Sepulcher of the First ones
- Added Zereth Mortis Zone

v1.1.4
- "Afterlife Express" (new): Added an option to display a reminder tooltip for riding carriages in Revendreth.
- Suggestions Tab:
-- Added numerous suggestions for Shadowlands zones.
-- Added suggestions for Torghast.
-- Added suggestions for Shadowlands covenants. If outside your covenant sanctum, you can see them by entering "Covenant" as the location. Other covenants' achievements can be seen using "Covenant (Kyrian)", "Covenant (Necrolord)", "Covenant (Night Fae)", or "Covenant (Venthyr)".
-- If the Location field is invalid, no achievements are suggested rather than defaulting to the current location's suggestions.
-- If there are no suggestions, the text indicating this will refer to a "specified location" if the Location field is used.
-- Fixed detection of whether the Cooking window is open.
- Fixed automatically untracking exploration exploration achievements too soon.
- Added an option to track exploration achievements when incomplete on the current character but completed by a different one.
- Fixed possible failure to automatically untrack timed battleground achievements.
- Fixed certain manually untracked achievements getting automatically retracked later when they shouldn't be.

v1.1.3
- Fixed an error where auto-tracking tried to track a completed achievement.

v1.1.2
- Updated TOC for WoW patch 9.0.2.
- "To All the Squirrels..." achievements: The four new achievements are now checked when looking for a critter's /loved status.
-- "To All the Squirrels Through Time and Space", "To All the Squirrels I Love Despite Their Scars", "To All the Squirrels I Set Sail to See", "To All the Squirrels I've Loved and Lost" (new)
- Suggestions Tab:
-- You can now auto-track suggested achievements. Shift+alt+click on an achievement in the Suggestions tab to toggle its flag. When you enter a location where a flagged achievement is suggested, it will automatically be tracked. It is untracked when you leave the area.
-- Enter "autotracked" into the Location field to see all achievements you've flagged for auto-tracking.
- Reworked the auto-tracking system. It should more intelligently handle which achievements are tracked, factoring in the number of available slots (excludes slots taken up by non-auto-tracked achievements) and priority levels.
-- If the tracking limit is reached, then lower priority achievements may be untracked to make space for higher priority ones.
-- Timed achievements have priority over exploration and suggested achievements.
-- Manually tracked achievements should not be automatically untracked. (This should already have been the case but may have failed under certain atypical circumstances.)
-- Manually untracked achievements will not be automatically tracked again until the player leaves the current zone. This excludes timed achievements; they will be tracked again if the timer restarts.
-- Auto-tracking in reaction to an "Achievement Progress" toast still simply tracks if space is available (no priority) and doesn't automatically untrack, so it isn't part of this system.
- Added achievements for Shadowlands zones to exploration auto-tracking.
- Fixed tooltip not showing when the cursor is over a tracked achievement in the Objectives frame.
- Tabs module: Shortened the tooltip shown for the Help ("?") icon on each tab so it is more specific to the selected tab. Hold Shift to see the full instructions as before.
- Trade module:
-- Now uses recipe IDs instead of names for achievement lookup. This solves some possible problems with finding cooking achievement criteria. (Theoretically, this was a problem for some non-English locales.)
-- Added support for a potential Skillet plugin.

v1.1.1

-- Added a few more Blizzard sounds.

v1.0.6
- Updated TOC for WoW patch 8.2.
- Suggestions Tab: New suggestions added for the zones Mechagon Island and Nazjatar, the dungeon Operation: Mechagon, and the raid The Eternal Palace.
- "Shake Your Bunny-Maker": Updated tooltip check to match its new requirements.

v1.0.5

- "Eat Your Greens" (new): Added an option to display a reminder tooltip for eating plants in Nazmir.
- Suggestions Tab:
-- Added suggestions for the Battle for Stromgarde warfront.

-- "Azeroth at War..." achievements: Missions can now be flagged as recently spotted objectives.
-- Fixed an issue where reminders triggered by a timer resulted in a tooltip indicating recently spotted objectives but with none listed.

v1.0.4
- "Azeroth at War: The Barrens", "Azeroth at War: After Lordaeron", "Azeroth at War: Kalimdor on Fire" (new): Added an option to display a reminder tooltip in the mission UI for completing missions.

- Fixed an issue where tooltips indicating whether an item needs to be consumed would appear even when the related option's checkbox was unchecked.
- Fixed reminder tooltip not showing for some mobs required for Legion's "Adventurer of..." achievements.
- Cache module: Fixed an issue that prevented the use of stored data from the opposing faction if a character of that faction hadn't been logged into since the release of a new WoW build or Overachiever version. (Data for the other faction should generally be considered reliable enough to use even if it will be rebuilt when you next log into a character of that faction.)

v1.0.3
- Trade module: "The Kul Tiran Menu" or "The Zandalari Menu" is now considered when determining if you need to cook a recipe.
- Fixed an issue where some of the opposing faction's achievements were sometimes automatically tracked in battlegrounds.
- Cache module:
-- This module now improves the accuracy of cross-faction data. For instance, the meta-achievement "Master of Warsong Gulch" requires a different version of "Quick Cap" for each faction. Without the cache module, only the "Quick Cap" for your own faction indicates that it is required by another achievement. With Overachiever_Cache enabled, both versions now indicate this.
-- For a complete cache, you will need to have logged into both an Alliance and a Horde character. (Most of the time, this is a non-issue. Most cached data is not faction specific. Even faction-specific achievements usually provide the same data to both factions.)
-- The tooltip indicating an achievement is required for a meta-achievement can now display an Alliance or Horde icon to show when the cache indicates the requirement is exclusive to one faction.
-- Fixed an issue where populating the cache while logged into a character of one faction prevented data from the other faction from being added.

v1.0.2
- Correct an issue that prevents the cache module from being loaded.

v1.0.1
- A new module has been added, Overachiever_Cache. When enabled (which it is by default), it should reduce load times once its cache is populated. The cache is rebuilt whenever Overachiever runs after a new build of WoW was released. (If the option "Startup: Throttle achievement lookup" is enabled, then this may improve performance instead of load time.)
- Trade module: Fix achievement information not showing in Cooking window.
- Suggestions Tab:
-- Added numerous suggestions for Battle for Azeroth zones.
-- Add more suggestions to the Draenor garrison.
-- Suggest "Choppin' Even More Logs" to Horde characters in their garrison instead of "Choppin' Some Logs" since the wrong faction's version was showing if the series progressed. (WoW API gives Alliance version as part of the series regardless of your faction.)
-- Suggest "Chromie Homie" at Wyrmrest Temple in Dragonblight (instead of only when actually inside The Deaths of Chromie scenario).
- Added achievements for Battle for Azeroth zones to exploration auto-tracking.

v1.0.0
- Updated for Battle for Azeroth beta and pre-patch, WoW patch 8.0.x. Updated TOC and made many required changes.
- This release is backward compatible with Legion. (This may not be the case for future releases.)
- Reworked the achievement search system. Searches should generally take less time and they now allow other activity to continue during a search.
- Search Tab:
-- "Personal" type split into "Personal" and "Other." The latter are achievements that do not have a category which belongs in the base UI. (Since all of them are unlisted achievements, selecting the "Other" type causes the search to include unlisted achievements even when the box to do so is unchecked.)
-- Added an option to direct searches started by slash commands (like "/ach") to the Search tab.
- When not directed to the Search tab, slash commands that searched for achievements will now also search through unlisted achievements. Excludes the "silent" slash commands such as "/achs". (When directed to the tab, whether they include unlisted achievements is determined by the relevant checkbox found there.)
- Minimap tooltips are now properly supported by the tooltip reminders feature. Up/down arrows (indicating a node's relative vertical position) do not prevent the reminder from showing and multiple nodes showing in the tooltip at once are now handled.
- Suggestions Tab: Added suggestions for Seething Shore.
- Tabs module: Added text overlay to indicate when the achievement completion filter (earned or incomplete) has caused an achievement to be omitted from the Suggestions or Related tabs.
- Improved ability to toggle tracking an achievement by ctrl+clicking on its link. Overachiever will now attempt to toggle tracking when the selected achievement is part of a series to which the linked achievement belongs (rather than requiring the linked achievement itself to be selected).
- Option "Startup: Throttle achievement lookup" is now disabled by default and it is automatically disabled for users upgrading from a pre-1.0 version of Overachiever.

v0.99.11
- New option added to exclude guild achievements from "need to kill" reminders.
- Added achievements for Argus zones to exploration auto-tracking.
- Fixed an issue where taint could be introduced when clicking a hyperlink.
- Suggestions Tab:
-- Added suggestions for Argus zones, the Seat of the Triumvirate, and Antorus, the Burning Throne.
-- Updated suggestions for Ulduar to account for 10- and 25-man achievements being replaced by new any-raid-size achievements.
- Tabs module: Added text overlay to indicate when the achievement completion filter (earned or incomplete) has caused an achievement to be omitted from the Search results or a Watch list.
- Fixed an error that can occur if the Tabs module is disabled and a holiday toast is clicked.

v0.99.10
- Change the way consumed item tracking works in an attempt to improve performance when bag contents change.
- Added option "Startup: Throttle achievement lookup" to replace the special variable THROTTLE_ACHLOOKUP. (For details on its purpose, see notes for v0.99.9.)

v0.99.9
- Updated for WoW patch 7.3. (Updated TOC and fixed common errors.)
- Holiday/Event Toasts: Added option to control the appearance of Miscellaneous toasts (such as raid release days). Disabled by default.
- Attempt to alleviate lag at startup for some users by stretching out the background work so it is less demanding each tick.
-- Some users with a high number of achievement points have reported problems with the background task. If the changes introduced in this version do not alleviate the problem, then advanced users can switch back to having the work done all at once on startup by changing the value of the variable THROTTLE_ACHLOOKUP in Overachiever.lua to false. (A better solution is being worked on.)
- Prevent potential temporary freeze that could occur if the kill-criteria background task is still running and the tooltip for a killable NPC is requested. Previously, the task was forced to completion in that event to ensure the tooltip would accurately display whether the NPC needs to be killed for an achievement. Now, only the data compiled so far is considered when updating the tooltip. (This means tooltips presented may be incomplete for up to several seconds after startup, depending on the achievement, but this seemed preferable to the freeze since it happened regardless of whether the NPC's tooltip ultimately needed an update.)

v0.99.8
- Updated for WoW patch 7.2.5. (Correct a problem with holiday/event toasts.)
- To reduce loading times, the process that examines achievement criteria has been removed from startup. It now does its work incrementally, in the background, until its task is complete.
- The Holiday/Event Toasts options "Do not automatically hide" and "Require click to hide" now default to disabled. (This only affects new installations of the addon. Current users' options are preserved.)
- The exploration achievement associated with Thunder Totem is now that of its parent zone, Highmountain.
- Suggestions Tab:
-- Added suggestions for the Blight Boar concert at the Darkmoon Faire, Black Temple timewalking, and The Deaths of Chromie scenario.
-- The zone Thunder Totem now shows suggestions from its parent zone, Highmountain.

v0.99.7
- Holiday/Event Toasts:
-- Added option to control the appearance of PvP Brawl toasts. Disabled by default.
-- Fix certain timewalking events being treated as holidays instead of dungeon events.
-- Fix failure to load texture for micro-holidays that take up two days in the calendar.

v0.99.6
- Updated for WoW patch 7.2.
- "Compare progress in others' links" option no longer adds a line indicating you completed the achievement (and when) because WoW 7.2 has made that redundant.
- Suggestions Tab:
-- Added suggestions for Broken Shore, Cathedral of Eternal Night, and Tomb of Sargeras, and additional suggestions for class order halls.
-- Suggest the new class armor set achievements in the appropriate instances, from Molten Core to Tomb of Sargeras.

v0.99.5
- New option added for toast notifications to control whether they will be hidden automatically (without interaction).
- Made toast notifications more reliable.
- Fix failure to load texture for one-day micro-holidays' toast nofications.
- Suggestions Tab: Suggest "Roll Club" in Vale of Eternal Blossoms.

v0.99.4
- New feature: Toast notifications for today's holidays/events. By default, today's holidays are displayed upon entering the game world. Clicking their toast frames will display related achievements in the Suggestions tab. Notifications for micro-holidays, bonus events, and dungeon events are also available but they are disabled by default.
- Separated battleground-win achievements from the option for auto-tracking timed achievements. The new option ("Auto-track timed battleground achievements") will also automatically untrack achievements it tracked upon leaving the battleground. The new implementation should fix an issue where the wrong achievements were automatically tracked in battlegrounds.
- Suggestions Tab:
-- Added suggestions for Brawler's Guild.
-- Fixed suggestion for Temple of Ahn'Qiraj not appearing in the instance.
-- Fixed criteria-specific suggestions for "Savage Hero".
- "Adventurer of Highmountain": Fixed inadvertent swap of two criteria (related to recently spotted objectives).

v0.99.3
- Fix error on startup for characters Overachiever hasn't seen before.

v0.99.2
- There can now be multiple objectives per achievement marked as a "Recently spotted objective", each individually tracked for the purposes of the Recent Reminders expiration time.
- Improved the way tooltip reminders are handled when the moused-over item has multiple associated achievements. Multiple lines should more reliably appear when applicable, and if two lines would be the same, they are consolidated (with extra text indicating the number of achievements that line applies to). (This should be extended to objects and players/NPCs in a future release.)
- Recent Reminders now expire after 3 minutes, up from 2.
- Suggestions Tab:
-- Added suggestions for these holidays/events: Lunar Festival, Love is in the Air, Noblegarden, Children's Week, Midsummer Fire Festival, Pirates' Day.
-- Fix suggestions for Assault on Violet Hold (dungeon) not showing automatically.
-- Suggest "The Garrison Campaign" at the player garrison.
-- When looking up suggestions while in an instance, try to first use instance name instead of zone name.
- Attempt to prevent unneeded calls to time-consuming statistic-reading related to the consumed item tracking system by only proceeding if we detect a possible statistic change.

v0.99.1
- "Adventurer of Azsuna", "Adventurer of Val'sharah": Added "need to kill" reminders for the criteria that needed manual entry of mob IDs.
- "Adventurer of Highmountain": Fixed incorrect "Recently spotted objective" text.
- Suggestions Tab: Fix inconsistency with the filter where a complete achievement is considered incomplete if it was suggested because of a criteria (the criteria being specific to your location while the achievement's other criteria are for elsewhere) and that criteria is incomplete for the current character.

v0.99
* HIGHLIGHT: New feature! You can now hide specific suggestions so they aren't shown to the current character. Use the "Show Hidden" checkbox or enter "hidden" into the Location field to see what you've hidden and "unhide" it, as needed.
- Moved key bindings to AddOns category.
- Overachiever's dropdown menus now respond to clicks anywhere instead of only on the down-arrow button.
- Made the default UI's "Achievement Filter" dropdown respond to clicks anywhere instead of only on the down-arrow button.
- "Adventurer of Highmountain", "Adventurer of Stormheim", "Adventurer of Suramar": Added "need to kill" reminders for these achievements. (Unlike the other Legion "Adventurer" achievements, they require every mob ID to be entered manually.) At this time, their reminders are only for NPCs that need to be killed; does not show a tooltip for interacting with objects (but if an object spawns an NPC that should be killed, it will show on the NPC).
- Suggestions Tab:
-- Ability to hide suggestions, as mentioned above.
-- Fix issue where the current instance's difficulty could be improperly detected, resulting in missing/wrong suggestions.
-- Suggest "Underbelly Tycoon" in correct zone (Dalaran (Broken Isles)).
-- Updated player garrison suggestions.
-- Fix failure to show suggestions for subzones of Shadowmoon Valley (Draenor) and Frostfire Ridge other than the garrison.
- Make TjBagWatch library a little more CPU efficient.

v0.98
- Updated for WoW patch 7.1.
- Suggestions Tab: Added suggestions for Return to Karazhan (dungeon), Trial of Valor (raid), and the new Suramar storylines ("Insurrection").
- Search Tab: "Name" field is now "Name or ID", allowing searches by achievement ID.

v0.97
- Suggestions Tab: Added additional suggestions for Draenor zones/dungeons/raids and Cataclysm raids. (Thanks to chrisnolanca for many of these.)
- "Draenor Angler" (new): Added an option to display a reminder tooltip for fishing nodes that you need to fish from. The Recent Reminders that result will actually be for its criteria achievements, since it is a meta-achievement.
- Now shows "Already fished" tooltip even if the entire achievement is complete (if the option is enabled) unless the achievement only required a certain number of fish from a list to be fished ("Limnologist", "Oceanographer").
- Fix detection of fishing poles for non-English locales.
- Fix "Pandarian Angler" reminder tooltips being shown based on the wrong option.
- Fixed issue where the position of the draggable Achievement UI was not used despite the "Remember position" option being enabled. The option once again divorces the Achievement UI from the positioning system used by Character Info, the Spellbook, etc.
- Attempt to fix addon compatibility issue resulting in an error message the first time the achievement frame is opened if Overachiever's draggable Achievement UI option is enabled.
- Tabs module: Fix problem where an achievement that was given a blue background due to being a future step of a series continued to use that background after it became the current step (because an achievement was completed that session).

v0.96
- New option added to prevent the reminder sound from being triggered by needing to kill a creature when you're already in combat with it. (Enabled by default.)
- Suggestions Tab: Fix failure to default to suggestions for Ironforge when in that zone.
- Fix addon compatibility issue resulting in an error on startup for some users.

v0.95
- New option: Add tooltip in achievement UI giving your character's progress on quantity-based achievements which were earned on your account but not with the current character.
- Tabs module: The new Related tab has been implemented, allowing you to better see a specified base achievement's related achievements. Ctrl+shift+click on an achievement in the UI or on an achievement link to specify the achievement and open the tab. ("Related" achievements are those that are in the same series as the base, are one of the criteria of the base or of another in its series, or have as one of their own criteria either the base or an achievement in its series).
- Suggestions Tab:
-- New option: Display graphical notices next to the achievement frame indicating today's holiday events. Click a notice to get related suggestions.
-- Added suggestions for these holidays/events: Brewfest, Darkmoon Faire, Hallow's End, Day of the Dead, Pilgrim's Bounty, Feast of Winter Veil (alias Winter Veil). Ties in to the notice feature mentioned above or you can see them manually by entering the holiday name into the Suggestions tab.
- Watch Tab: Fixed an issue where, when naming a new list, hitting Enter ignored whether the name was valid.
- Slash command /oa now opens to the main options panel. However, the sub-panels list is expanded so you can easily get to Reminder Tooltips options.
- Fixed some visual elements of the options panel and Tabs module (missing background colors, etc.).

v0.94
- "Draenor Cuisine" (new): Added to the consumed item tracking system.
- "Brewfest Diet" (new): Added options to display a reminder tooltip for Brewfest food you need to eat.
- "Fairegoer's Feast" (new): Added options to display a reminder tooltip for Darkmoon Faire food you need to eat.
- The "Recently spotted objective" feature now works with items you need to consume.
- Trade module: "The Draenor Gourmet" and "The Legion Menu" are now considered when determining if you need to cook a recipe.
- Stopped a crash that could occur if you attempt to open to an achievement that is really a statistic.
- Fixed an issue where your progress was being added to achievement tooltips when doing so was redundant.
- The "Creature killed?" option for general Kill Creature Achievements now defaults to being enabled. (Your setting won't change if you are upgrading from a previous version of the addon.)
- Suggestions Tab:
-- Can now tell the different "Shadowmoon Valley" and "Nagrand" zones apart.
-- Added several new suggestions for the Darkmoon Faire.
-- Moved "Weed Whacker" suggestion to The Everbloom, where it belongs.
-- Added other suggestions for The Everbloom so "Weed Whacker" doesn't feel lonely.
-- Added suggestions for the player garrison.
-- Added additional suggestions for some other Draenor zones.

v0.93
- Fix an issue where the tooltip disappears when it shouldn't. (When this was depends on user's other addons.)

v0.92
- New options: Can now react to the Achievement Progress toast by tracking the achievement, linking the achievement and showing the completed criteria in the chat log, and/or adding the achievement to the Suggestions tab as a "Recent Reminder".
- Added a "Recently spotted objective" tooltip for certain types of achievements in the achievement UI when they are on the Recent Reminders list. The tooltip indicates what was seen that triggered the reminder. (E.g., it would show the name of the mob that you need to kill or the player you need to blast with your Turkey Shooter.) Helpful when you briefly run the mouse over something that triggers the reminder sound (if you turned that on!) but you don't know what it was.
- Fixed reminder tooltips not showing for achievements that identified the mob by ID (non-critter "need to kill" achievements).
- Fixed reminder tooltips for world objects disappearing after a short while due to the default tooltip resetting its text periodically.
- Fixed reminder tooltips for world objects sometimes not showing if the tooltip previously showed mob data.
- Attempt to fix compatibility issue with other addons resulting in an error that appears when the achievement frame is opened.
- Fixed reminder tooltips for certain fishing nodes not showing. (Note that, like several other features, this is localization-dependent. If it doesn't work with a non-English locale, you can help fix this by contributing on CurseForge. The relevant phrase key in this case is "ACH_FISHSCHOOL_FORMAT". If you see a node I missed in English, let me know.)

v0.91
- Suggestions Tab:
-- Added numerous suggestions for Legion zones, dungeons, and raids.
-- Added "Mythic" to instance difficulty override dropdown.
-- Now considers the different "Dalaran" zones individually (so suggestions for Dalaran in Northrend don't show in other Dalaran zones).

v0.90
- Updated for WoW patch 7.0.x. Updated TOC and fixed several errors. (Haven't added new suggestions yet.)
- Fixed problem where reminder sounds didn't play.
- Added some new reminder sounds (from existing sound effects).
- "The Stockade" zone (instance) was renamed at some point to "Stormwind Stockade". Updated the related suggestion so it once again shows when in that zone.

v0.84
- Workaround for a WoW bug where the API gives the wrong count of achievements in a category. This should fix debug
  message spam when doing an achievement search as well as an error when searching by achievement criteria (or
  searching by "Any").

v0.83
- Updated for WoW patch 6.2.
- Suggestions Tab: Added suggestions for Tanaan Jungle and the "storylines" and "bonus objectives" achievements for the
  other Draenor zones.

v0.82
- Updated for WoW patch 6.1.
- Suggestions Tab: Added suggestions for Ashran.
- Attempt to fix an error that appeared upon completion of achievements and certain instances.
- Fixed the options panels not being populated when first shown.
- Fixed "/oa" and related slash commands not opening the correct options panel if the UI options window hadn't been
  opened before in that session.

v0.81
- Suggestions Tab: Added new Darkmoon Faire suggestions.
- Fixed issue where all checkboxes start as checked in the Overachiever options panels even if the saved option was
  really false/disabled.
- Fixed an error related to auto-tracking. (This resulted in error messages when traveling from zone to zone if the
  exploration auto-tracking option was enabled.)
- "Auto-track timed achievements" option is now enabled by default. (No change if not using a fresh install of the
  addon.)

v0.80
- Initial updates for WoW patch 6.0.x. Fixes the most common errors.

v0.73
- Updated for WoW patch 5.4.
- Suggestions Tab:
-- Added suggestions for Siege of Orgrimmar, Deepwind Gorge, and Timeless Isle.
-- Removed suggestions that are now Feats of Strength.

v0.71
- Updated for WoW patch 5.2.
- Tabs module: Corrected a taint issue that could occur when achievements were added to a Watch list from another tab.
- Suggestions Tab: Added suggestions for Throne of Thunder, Isle of Thunder, and a missing one for Vale of Eternal
  Blossoms ("Eternally in the Vale").

v0.70
- Updated for WoW patch 5.1.
- "Pandaren Cuisine" and "Pandaren Delicacies" (new): Added to the consumed item tracking system.
- "Pandarian Angler" (new): Added reminder tooltips for this achievement, expanding the existing option for "The
  Scavenger," "Outland Angler," and "Northrend Angler."
- Kill Creature Achievements: Fixed an issue where reminder tooltips weren't working. (This means you, "Glorious!")
- Trade module: "The Pandaren Gourmet" is now considered when determining if you need to cook a recipe.
- Suggestions Tab, Kill Creature Achievements: When a reminder that you need to kill one of these creatures is
  triggered, the related achievement will temporarily be added to the suggestions list, as intended.
- Suggestions Tab: Suggestions added for Mists of Pandaria raids.
- Suggestions Tab: Fixed an issue where Cooking and Fishing achievements could "take over" the list, preventing you
  from seeing other suggestions once you looked at the tab while the Cooking tradeskill window was open or your fishing
  pole was equipped.
- Switched to LibBabble-Subzone library for zone/subzone localizations. (Should correct some issues with suggestions,
  among other things, for users with non-English clients.)

v0.69
- Fixed an issue where critters that were reclassified as wild pets wouldn't trigger achievement reminders.
- "Turkey Lurkey": Fixed an issue where the proper tooltip reminder wouldn't be displayed in some cases.

v0.68
- Tabs module: Improved performance when switching tabs and scrolling through achievement lists.
- Suggestions Tab:
-- Instance difficulty and raid size override options added. Use them to see suggestions that have particular
   difficulty and/or raid size requirements without having to change your actual instance/group settings.
-- Numerous suggestions added for Mists of Pandaria zones, battlegrounds, and dungeons.
-- Now suggests "Big City Pet Brawlin' - Alliance" and "Big City Pet Brawlin' - Horde" when in an Alliance or Horde
   capital city, respectively.
-- The "Complete X quests" achievements for Loch Modan and Wetlands were merged into one achievement. Likewise,
   those for Westfall and Duskwood were merged. Suggestions updated to reflect this.
-- Several Horde-specific achievements were merged into their Alliance-specific counterparts. (For instance, "Hail to
   the Chef" had a Horde version and an Alliance version with separate IDs. The ID used by Alliance characters is now
   also used by Horde characters.) Suggestions updated to reflect this.
- Italian localization (itIT) is now supported.
- Remember, translations are provided by users like you. Thanks for your generosity! Please help contribute if you are
  able: http://wow.curseforge.com/projects/overachiever/localization/

v0.67
- "To All the Squirrels I Once Caressed?" (new): Critters' /loved status for this achievement is now part of the option
  that exists for the other "To All the Squirrels..." achievements.
- Fixed an issue where an error was thrown if a battle pet container item is in your inventory.

v0.66
- Updated for WoW patch 5.0.4.
- Unfortunately, the WoW API no longer supports grabbing item IDs from "Tastes Like Chicken" and "It's Happy Hour
  Somewhere". Consequently, we cannot automatically detect new consumable items added to the list of those that give
  credit toward these achievements. Overachiever will instead use whatever list the character had before (saved from
  using Overachiever previously) or, if that is unavailable, a default list of items based on data collected in a prior
  version of WoW.

v0.65
- Updated for WoW patch 4.3.
- Suggestions Tab: Added suggestions for the Darkmoon Faire, Twin Peaks battleground, Tol Barad/Tol Barad Peninsula,
  and Alterac Valley. ("The Alterac Blitz" was moved out of the meta-achievement so it's now a suggestion, lest it be
  forgotten!)
- Brazilian Portuguese localization (ptBR) is now supported.
- Remember, translations are provided by users like you. Thanks for your generosity! Please help contribute if you are
  able: http://wow.curseforge.com/projects/overachiever/localization/

v0.64
- Updated for WoW patch 4.2.
- Suggestions Tab: Removed several suggestions that are now Feats of Strength and one that was removed from the game.
- Suggestions Tab: Added new suggestions for Mount Hyjal, Molten Front, Firelands, Zul'Aman, and Zul'Gurub, as well as
  for the new fishing and cooking daily quests.
- "You'll Feel Right as Rain" (new): Added an option to display a reminder tooltip for gorging yourself on Chocolate
  Cookies.
- "Check Your Head" and "Shake Your Bunny-Maker": Fixed an issue where some races were associated with the wrong
  criteria. (Blizzard added goblins and worgen to the criteria and also changed the order.)
- Updated options layout.

v0.63
- Updated for WoW patch 4.1.
- "Cataclysmically Delicious" and "Drown Your Sorrows" added to the consumed item tracking system.
- Suggestions Tab: Added suggestion for The Battle for Gilneas.
- Minor update to options layout.

v0.62
- Suggestions Tab: Updated suggestions to include Cataclysm dungeons. (Thanks Ackis!)
- Further optimized the reminder tooltip system to improve performance.
- Reduced loading time by saving the full consumed item tracking data between sessions (instead of partial data). If
  the addon version or the game build has changed since you last played a character, or if the character's data is not
  already saved, then load time will be about the same as it was previously because the data will be (re)built.

v0.61
- "Limnologist" and "Oceanographer" (new): Added an option to display reminder tooltips for schools of fish associated
  with these achievements.
- Fixed a compatibility issue with the addon MoveAnything where an error was given when the main achievement UI was
  first loaded if MoveAnything was used to reposition AchievementFrame.
- Fixed an issue where an error message appeared when certain tooltips were displayed.
- Trade module: Corrected an issue where uncooked recipes were treated as if you needed to cook them to earn an
  achievement even if the achievement was already completed. A new interface option has been added to support previous
  behavior, so achievement icons can be placed next to uncooked recipes even if the overall achievement is complete.
- Watch Tab: Invalid achievements are now removed from existing Watch lists when the Tabs module loads. This prevents
  errors that could result from watching achievements that subsequently are removed from the game by Blizzard.

v0.60
- You can now search for guild achievements using slash commands and the Tabs module. On the Search tab, a new option
  has been added to allow you to search personal achievements, guild achievements, or all achievements.
- The tooltip that shows which guild members have contributed to the completion of a guild achievement is no longer
  overridden by Overachiever tooltips. Additionally, this information is now displayed where appropriate when viewing
  guild achievements on tabs created by the Tabs module.
- Tabs module: Guild achievements now use the interface art intended for them on all tabs instead of only the Guild
  tab.
- Tabs module: If a guild achievement is selected or the Search tab was set to search only guild achievements, then
  the points shown at the top of the main achievement UI will show Guild Points instead of personal Achievement Points.
- Tabs module: Sorting by points now functions as most would expect, adding points from previous achievements in its
  series (if it is in one) to the points the achievement is worth alone. (This is the same way the points shown on the
  shield on the right-hand side of a displayed achievement are calculated.)
- Tabs module: Expanded the scope of the throttle in order to address performance issues.
- Suggestions Tab: Updated zone-based suggestions.
- "It's Happy Hour Somewhere" and "Tastes Like Chicken": Corrected an issue where an item could sometimes be consumed
  without being properly recorded.
- Fixed a compatibility issue with the addon Failchievements where an error was given when the cursor was placed over
  a custom meta-criteria "achievement."
- Trade module: Fixed an issue where filters (such as "Has skill up") would cause the icons and tooltips added by
  Overachiever to be displayed incorrectly.

v0.59
- Corrected an issue where Vashj'ir achievements weren't being suggested or auto-tracked.
- Tabs module: Addressed some performance issues by throttling an event that can be called frequently in combat.
- Trade module: "The Cataclysmic Gourmet" is now considered when determining if you need to cook a recipe.
- The exploration auto-tracking option will no longer cause tracking to switch away from "Stood in the Fire,"
  "Surveying the Damage," or "From Hell's Heart I Stab at Thee."
- The option to automatically track completed exploration achievements in addition to incomplete ones has been
  removed. (The ability to track completed achievements was removed from the WoW UI in a previous patch.)

v0.58
- Suggestions Tab: Added many suggestions for zone-specific achievements ("complete X quests," exploration, and more)
  as well as new Fishing and Cooking achievements. Removed some suggestions made obsolete by the Cataclysm.
- "To All the Squirrels Who Cared for Me" (new): Critters' /loved status for this achievement is now part of the
  option that exists for "To All The Squirrels I've Loved Before" and "To All The Squirrels Who Shared My Life."
- The Dynamic Difficulty system is now considered when determining whether the current instance is Heroic.

v0.57
- Updated for WoW patch 4.0.1.

v0.56
- Watch Tab: Separate "Global," "Character-Specific," and custom-named watch lists can now be created. (All are saved
  per-account so the player can access them from any character.) You can also select a Default List to be set as the
  active (or "Displayed") list upon logging in. Additionally, you can copy watched achievements from the active list
  to another list you specify using the Watch tab interface.

v0.55
- Updated for WoW patch 3.3.5.
- Fixed a pervasive taint issue that could result in blocked actions as taint eventually spreads to various UI elements
  (such as the Dungeon Finder).
- Achievements are no longer tracked between sessions to resume when you log in because WoW now does this by default.

v0.54
- Suggestions Tab: Added suggestions for Trial of the Champion, Trial of the (Grand) Crusader, Icecrown Citadel, The
  Forge of Souls, Halls of Reflection, and Pit of Saron.
- Non-Heroic versions of creatures should no longer trigger a "need to kill" reminder tooltip for Heroic achievements
  in most (if not all) cases. Please report any cases where this improper reminder still occurs.

v0.53
- "Fistful of Love": Fixed an issue where the reminder tooltip wasn't displayed properly.

v0.52
- Fixed an error that sometimes occurred when achievement criteria or statistics were updated.
- Trade module: Now supports the addon Producer. Instead of ctrl+clicking on a recipe to open to the relevant
  achievement, simply left click on the achievement listed in the popup menu for that recipe. If you shift+click on the
  listed achievement, it will be linked to chat.

v0.51
- Updated for WoW patch 3.3.
- Suggestions Tab: "Master Angler of Azeroth" is now suggested when a fishing pole is equipped while in Stranglethorn
  Vale or most Northrend zones.

v0.50
- "Turkey Lurkey": Option added to show whether you need to use your Turkey Shooter on players in their tooltips.
- Options that add reminders to tooltips are now in their own interface options panel (a sub-category to the main
  Overachiever panel) and they have had their checkbox text simplified (English localization).
- When /oa would open to an interface options panel, the new Reminder Tooltips panel is used.
- Achievement name labels in Overachiever's interface options now include icons that can be interacted with: Mouse-over
  to see achievement details, click to open to the achievement, shift+click to link to chat.
- "It's Happy Hour Somewhere" and "Tastes Like Chicken": Consumed item tracking now occurs whether or not the option
  to show tooltip reminders about these achievements is enabled.
- Suggestions Tab: Fixed an issue where the tab key didn't always cycle through locations when it should.

v0.48
- Suggestions Tab: Zone/instance and subzone override options added. Use them to see suggestions for locations far and
  near without actually traveling there!
- "Check Your Head": Fixed an issue where some races were associated with the wrong criteria.

v0.47
- "Check Your Head": Option added to show whether you need to use a Weighted Jack-o'-Lantern on players in their
  tooltips.
- Suggestions Tab: Implemented proper differentiation between 10- and 25-man raid achievements and proper detection
  of whether the player is in a Heroic instance, whether it is a 10- or 25-man raid instance, and (when not in an
  instance) the current raid/dungeon difficulty settings.
- Suggestions Tab: Many new suggestions added: Ulduar, Icecrown's Argent Tournament, Isle of Conquest, Onyxia's Lair
  (level 80 version), and more.
- Kill Creature Achievements: Now only shows a reminder if the player can attack the unit. This prevents reminders to
  destroy certain siege weapons (which can be either friendly or hostile) while they are friendly, for example.
- The option to not play a reminder sound for fishing node reminders if a fishing pole is equipped no longer affects
  whether achievements are added to the list of recent reminders.
- "Show achievement IDs" option now affects tooltips in the main achievement UI.

v0.46
- Timed achievements are now added to the Suggestions list when the timer starts.
- Achievements added in WoW 3.2 are now included in search results.
- Suggestions Tab: Fixed an error that occurred when looking at Suggestions while in Wintergrasp.

v0.45
- Updated for WoW patch 3.2.
- Suggestions Tab: Now only displays "The Fishing Diplomat" when appropriate for your current location as determined
  by whether the relevant criteria is complete and the current filter ("Earned"/"Incomplete"/"All"). For instance, if
  you are in Stormwind and the "Stormwind" criteria is complete, "The Fishing Diplomat" is only suggested when the
  filter is set to "All" or "Earned."
- Trade module: Fixed an issue where, with English clients, Worm Delight wasn't considered a requirement of "The
  Northrend Gourmet" because WoW lists it as "Wyrm Delight" in the achievement itself.

v0.44
- "It's Happy Hour Somewhere" and "Tastes Like Chicken": Implemented a system to work around the fact that, since
  WoW 3.1, addons cannot use Blizzard's API to query whether a specific item has already been consumed. The new system
  tracks whether items have been consumed itself and stores this on a per-character basis. The primary drawback to this
  is that all items are labeled as unconsumed until Overachiever v0.44+ "sees" you consume them (even if you consumed
  them before). (Additionally, in the rare event of a rollback, items may be marked as consumed when the character
  hasn't actually consumed them.)
- Trade module: Fixed an issue where, with English clients, "The Northrend Gourmet" didn't consider Rhinolicious
  Wormsteak as a requirement because WoW lists it as "Rhinolicious Wyrmsteak" in the achievement itself.
- Suggestions Tab: The Horde-specific versions of "Destruction Derby" and "Master of Wintergrasp" are now suggested
  to Horde players in Wintergrasp instead of the Alliance versions.

v0.43
- Added an option to display whether you need to kill a creature for an achievement in its tooltip. This applies not
  only to such achievements as "Northern Exposure" and "Medium Rare," but many others. See the option's tooltip
  in-game for more information.
- enGB clients: Fixed an issue where the completion date shown when comparing your progress with another's in an
  achievement link appeared in the enUS format instead of dd/mm/yy.

v0.42
- "Shake Your Bunny-Maker": Players of an unknown level ("skulls") are now assumed to be at least level 18. (While
  this won't always be the case, it's worth the assumption most of the time.)

v0.41
- "Shake Your Bunny-Maker": Option added to show whether you need to use Spring Flowers on players in their tooltips.
- Unit tooltips can now show multiple reminders when applicable.
- Tabs module: Achievement filters ("Earned"/"Incomplete"/"All") for each tab in the main UI are now saved between
  sessions (including the default tab).
- Tabs module: Fixed a display glitch that occurred when switching to an Overachiever tab if the previous tab's
  categories list was long enough to be scrollable.
- Fixed an issue that caused the client to lock up if the Objectives frame was used to attempt to open the UI to an
  achievement that is exclusive to the opposing faction.
- Trade module: Fixed an issue where, with English clients, "The Northrend Gourmet" didn't consider Spiced Worm
  Burger as a requirement because it is incorrectly listed as "Spiced Wyrm Burger" in the achievement itself by
  Blizzard. A system is now in place to allow translators to make these name substitutions for cooking achievements'
  criteria. (See the context notes for the TRADE_COOKING_OBJRENAME phrase in the Curse Forge localization system.)
- Mexican localization (esMX) is now supported. It falls back on Spanish (esES) translations when esMX-specific ones
  are unavailable.
- All localizations are now supported in the base code, though not all have translations. Please help contribute if
  you are able: http://wow.curseforge.com/projects/overachiever/localization/

v0.40
- Updated for WoW patch 3.1.
- Options involving the now-defunct achievement tracker have been removed. The default UI's new Objectives frame (AKA
  Watch Frame) has taken its place, and it is draggable.
- The remaining features that involved some interaction with the old tracker's icons are now associated with the
  achievement titles displayed by the Objectives frame (since the new frame does not use achievement icons). This
  includes achievement tooltip display and Shift+clicking to produce chat links.
- Watch Tab: You can now Alt+click on an achievement's chat link to watch it.

v0.39
- Tabs module: The new Watch tab has been implemented, allowing you to create a custom list of achievements. Alt+click
  on an achievement in another tab to watch it. Alt+click on an achievement in the Watch tab to stop watching it.

v0.38
- New option: Auto-track timed achievements.
- The exploration auto-tracking option will no longer cause tracking to switch away from "Bloody Rare," "Northern
  Exposure," or their followup achievements.

v0.37
- Tabs module: You can now use the dropdown added to the default UI in WoW 3.0.8 to filter Search results and
  Suggestions. The Suggestions filter defaults to "Incomplete"; by changing it, you can now display achievements that
  you've already earned.
- Suggestions Tab: Added battleground achievements.
- Suggestions Tab: Added Cooking and Fishing achievements. When the Cooking tradeskill window is open, all suggestions
  will be for Cooking. Otherwise, if a fishing pole is equipped, all suggestions will be for Fishing. In other cases,
  Cooking and Fishing achievements specific to the zone you're in will be shown alongside other relevant achievements.

v0.36
- Trade module: Now supports lilsparky's branch of Skillet. Because that addon uses ctrl-clicking on recipes to do
  something else, use Alt instead to open to the achievement associated with the recipe.
- Fixed an issue that occurred when using a client that isn't updated to WoW 3.0.8 yet (Chinese).
- Revamped the localization system.

v0.35
- Trade module: You can now ctrl-click on a recipe in the list to open the achievement UI to the achievement for which
  you still need to cook the recipe.
- Trade module: Now supports the addon Advanced Trade Skill Window.
- Suggestions Tab: Added several new zone-based suggestions.
- Fixed various situational bugs.

v0.34
- Trade module: Now supports the addon Skillet. Achievement icons are placed before the names of recipes you need to
  cook in the main list. Tooltips and text beneath the selected recipe's reagents list indicate which achievements
  are associated with the recipe.
- Extra feature for Skillet users: A new sorting method, "By Achievement," is provided. This sorts the list of recipes
  by the number of achievements the recipe is associated with (provided you haven't already cooked the given recipe),
  then by the name of the first such achievement (which is "first" is determined by ID, though currently there is no
  overlap between relevant achievements), and finally, by the recipe name.
- Trade module: Fixed an error that occurs with non-English clients.
- Updated German localization.

v0.33
- "The Northrend Gourmet" and "The Outland Gourmet": Pulled this functionality out of the core addon and placed it
  into a new module, Overachiever_Trade. The module may be disabled or deleted if desired.
- The new module is far more efficient and accurate than the old system and fixes an issue where the reminder icon
  system didn't always initialize properly (which resulted in no icons appearing in the trade skill UI).
- Updated most localizations.

v0.32
- "Pest Control" (new): Added an option to display reminder tooltips for critters you need to kill.
- "To All The Squirrels Who Shared My Life" (new): Critters' /loved status for this achievement is now part of the
  option that exists for "To All The Squirrels I've Loved Before."
- "The Northrend Gourmet" and "The Outland Gourmet" (new): In the trade skill UI, an achievement shield icon is now
  placed next to recipes that you currently need to cook in order to earn these achievements. A tooltip indicates
  which achievement requires the given recipe.
- Added an option to display a tooltip when the cursor is over an achievement in the main achievement UI giving the
  names of any meta-achievements that list this achievement as a criteria.
- Changed achievement sorting so that two strings beginning with numbers compare the numbers first. This means
  "5 Exalted Reputations" is now listed before "20 Exalted Reputations," for example.
- Updated most localizations. Translations are generously provided by users like you! Please help contribute if you
  are able: http://wow.curseforge.com/projects/overachiever/localization/

v0.31
- Suggestions Tab: Many new suggestions based on your current location are possible, including those for: completing
  a number of quests in your zone, goals to accomplish in your current dungeon or raid instance (or, in some cases,
  one you are near), Heroic dungeon or raid goals when that is the current difficulty mode, City PvP goals when
  in a capitol city (varying, depending on your faction and which city it is), Wintergrasp PvP, and more.
- Suggestions Tab: Achievements you were reminded about through a tooltip within the last 2 minutes are now given as
  suggestions. Additionally, any such achievement in any Overachiever-provided tab has its background colored green
  for quick identification.
- "It's Happy Hour Somewhere" and "Tastes Like Chicken": Now examines item IDs instead of names, making this option
  more reliable.
- If draggable frames with saved positions are used and you log in with a character that doesn't have a position saved
  for one of these frames yet, the position used by the previous character is applied. (Positions are still saved per
  character, so each one can have a different layout if desired. This simply removes the need for dragging frames to
  the same location every time you log in with a new character.)
- Format of the completion date shown when comparing your progress with another's in an achievement link changed to
  dd/mm/yy for enGB and non-English clients.
- Fixed an issue where the achievement frame wouldn't save its position if the achievement UI loaded earlier than
  normal (as another addon may cause to be the case).
- "Let It Snow" and "Fistful of Love": Reminders should now trigger properly with non-English clients.
- Spanish localization updated.

v0.30
- Added an option to display a tooltip when the cursor is over an achievement in the main achievement UI that is part
  of a series in order to display the names of other achievements in the series and its relation to them.
- The Overachiever Tabs module has been released! This adds two new tabs to the default achievement UI. This module
  is installed as a separate addon: The Overachiever_Tabs folder goes in the AddOns folder along with the Overachiever
  folder. The module can be disabled or you can opt to not install it without affecting the core addon's
  functionality.
- The first new tab is Search. Use it to search for achievements by name, description, criteria, and/or reward. You
  can opt to only display achievements available in the normal UI or to include all achievements, including those
  exclusive to the opposing faction, etc.
- The second new tab is Suggestions. This is where Overachiever will display achievements you might be interested in
  based on your character's current circumstances. For now, it simply displays incomplete exploration achievements for
  the current zone, but more is planned for the future.
- Key bindings have been added to open to the Search and Suggestions tabs. Set them in the default key bindings
  interface.
- Individual tabs can be disabled without disabling the entire Tabs module by renaming or deleting the individual
  file that creates that tab. That'd be either Search.lua or Suggestions.lua.
- Compensated for a Blizzard typo that made Tel'Abim Bananas get overlooked by the "Tastes Like Chicken" check when
  using an English client.
- Spanish localization implemented. (Some unresolved issues remain. Please report any you find.)
- Updated German localization.

v0.25
- Updated localizations: French, traditional Chinese.

v0.24
- New option for "It's Happy Hour Somewhere" and "Tastes Like Chicken": Show whether an item needs to be consumed
  in its tooltip. A second new option has this display even when the achievement is complete (for the curious).
- New option added to choose a sound effect to play when reminder text is added to the tooltip about an incomplete
  achievement. It will not play more than once every 15 seconds. This uses LibSharedMedia, so any sound registered
  with that library can be selected. (No sound selected by default.)
- New option added to prevent the reminder sound from being triggered by fishing nodes when your fishing pole is
  equipped. (Enabled by default.)
- Fixed a compatibility issue that produced an error when some addons made the tooltip show before Overachiever was
  fully initialized.
- Simplified Chinese localization implemented.

v0.23
- When you enable an exploration achievement auto-tracking option, tracking begins immediately (if applicable) instead
  of requiring you to enter a new zone.
- Slash commands /oa, /oasilent, and /oas now show Overachiever's interface options instead of the main achievement UI
  when no argument is provided.
- Updated to latest LibBabble-Zone-3.0 (used for auto-tracking of exploration zones).

v0.22
- Fixed an issue that could cause taint if the draggable achievement tracker is enabled when performing certain
  actions while in combat, such as entering/exiting a vehicle.
- Updated localizations: German, traditional Chinese.

v0.21
- "Let It Snow" and "Fistful of Love" achievements: Options added to show whether you need to use a Handful of
  Snowflakes or a Handful of Rose Petals on players in their tooltips.
- Traditional Chinese and Russian localizations updated.

v0.20
- "Well Read" achievement option expanded to include "Higher Learning."
- New option: Show in fishing nodes' tooltips whether you need to fish them for "The Scavenger," "Outland Angler,"
  or "Northrend Angler."
- Fixed an error that occurred when trying to open to an achievement that isn't in the normal UI. (For example,
  achievements exclusive to the opposing faction.)
- Russian localization implemented.

v0.18
- New option for "Well Read" achievement: Add whether you've read a relevant book to its tooltip.

v0.17
- The achievement tracker is now draggable.
- Traditional Chinese localization implemented.

v0.16
- Quantity-based criteria progress is now added to the tooltip even if it is of the type that would not use a
  progress bar when it is tracked, including information that is normally hidden from the user.
- When there are multiple criteria, your progress with each is now inserted directly next to its listing on the
  achievement tooltip. (Combined with the above change, you might see something like this: "Assault 2 bases (0/2).")
- Achievement progress comparison feature added, replacing the option to simply show your "progress bar data" in
  others' achievement links.

v0.15
- Revamped automatic tracking of exploration achievements to better support non-English clients.
- French localization implemented.

v0.14
- New option added to save the position of the draggable Achievement UI.
- Corrected German localization issue. Further work may be necessary, but this should be an improvement.

v0.13
- German localization implemented.

v0.12
