**9/9/22 UPDATE**

Dragonflight has broken Overachiever and broken to a point that without rebuilding a lot of the code, is a lot more than I have the time to manage.
Come 10.0 Overachiever will no longer be updated/working
Krowi, of [Krowi Achievement Filter](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/krowi-achievement-filter), has been amazing enough to reach out and help keep and addon working similar to Overachiever (and is still making it better!)

Thank you all! Happy Raiding, leveling, friend making, dungeons & monster slaying fun!

Not Original addon Creator, Just someone who loves the addon who wanted to make it work for SL

Mainly fixed the suggestions tab to show up Achievements for SL locations/Zones

Remember to Ignore the original addon on any addon Downloader

Will remove this if addon creator comes back and requests me to remove

I do not own any rights to this, only to help out other Overachievers

Download zip file, only need the Overachiever & Lib folders, Read-me & changelog not needed
